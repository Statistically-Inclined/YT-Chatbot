title: India’s GPU War Is Heating Up: 7 Finalists, 14,517 Chips, 1 AI Future
description: India’s race to build its own AI infrastructure just hit a major milestone. MeitY has shortlisted seven companies for Round 2 of its GPU tender—part of a massive ₹10,000 crore mission to create the country’s AI compute backbone. From Netmagic and Yotta to AWS-backed Vensysco and Oracle-backed Ishan Infotech, the lineup reflects a new era of AI partnerships and scale. With over 14,500 GPUs already bid, including NVIDIA H100s, AMD MI300s, and Intel Gaudi 3s, this isn’t just a hardware play—it’s a full-stack AI moment.

The GPUs will power projects like Sarvam AI’s multilingual LLMs and national-scale GenAI infrastructure, as India accelerates toward AI self-reliance. With the final technical presentations set for May 14 and Round 3 already open, this is just the beginning. Watch the full breakdown as we explore who’s in, what’s at stake, and how India is assembling the next chapter of its AI story.
