2. So it turns out that India isn't just
3. buying GPUs to power its AI future, but
4. it's building its own AI infrastructure
5. backboard. The Ministry of Electronics
6. and IT just shortlisted seven firms for
7. the second round of the India AI GPU
8. tender, which happens to be one of the
9. biggest compute grabs in the country's
10. history. So the shortlisted companies
11. are Netmagic, which happens to be a
12. Google Cloud partner and then you have
13. Scy Future India, which is approved by
14. the ministry. Then you have CPI
15. Technologies, Wisco Technologies, which
16. is backed by AWS. Then you have Locus,
17. which is also tied with AWS. And you
18. have Yota data services, Ishan Infoch,
19. which is backed by Oracle. They're now
20. invited for a technical presentation on
21. May 14th, which happens to be the final
22. gate before a 10,000 cr rupees worth of
23. compute is handed over. So the ministry
24. expects to procure 15,000 GPUs through
25. this round. To put that into
26. perspective, that's more than 14 times
27. the capacity allocated in round one. And
28. according to the bids seen by the
29. economic times, the combined offers have
30. already crossed
31. 14,517 GPUs, all at L1, meaning the
32. lowest rates. So, Wensysco, AWS, and App
33. Squads are offering 2,000 Nvidia H100s.
34. And then you have 100 AWS Trienium chips
35. and 200 AWS Inferentia 2. And as a
36. bonus, over,300 GPUs over their last
37. bid. Locus which happens to be one of
38. the top L1 biders in round one is back
39. again with a new strategy. Well, the
40. details remain confidential for now and
41. Sci future India
42. has,184 GPUs in the pipeline and this
43. consists of Nvidia H100's L40s. Then you
44. also have the A100. You also have AMD's
45. chips, the MI300, the Mi325 and then
46. from Intel you have their Godi 2 and the
47. Godi 3. So Scy Future AI is already
48. building a homegrown platform. Look,
49. it's not just about hardware, right?
50. because these GPUs will power India's
51. server in LLM efforts which includes
52. server AAI's 70 billion parameter
53. multilingual model and also a population
54. scale geni deployments then of course
55. the secure cloudnative public
56. infrastructure and with countries like
57. US tightening GPU exports India is
58. racing against geopolitics to build a
59. self-reliant AI muscle so what's next so
60. in May 14th you have technical
61. presentations and post that there's the
62. final selection and just announced is
63. the round three of the GPU tender It's
64. already open. And what is the next phase
65. of India's AI revolution? You may ask.
66. You'll witness it at Cipher 2025 this
67. September 17th to 19th in Bengaluru.
68. Because the future of AI won't just be
69. made in Silicon Valley. So, got your
70. tickets yet? Link is in the comments.
71. And this year, Cipher is dedicated to
72. one big mission which is building AI in
73. India. So, if you're a founder, drop a
74. comment telling us what you're building
75. and we might just feature you next. This
76. is Front Page by A IMTV. See you in the
77. next update soon. And you already know
78. what's coming, which is Think AI. Think
79. AIM.
